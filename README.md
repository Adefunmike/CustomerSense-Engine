**CustomerSense Engine** is an intelligent customer analytics and prediction platform that leverages machine learning and automated agent orchestration to help businesses understand their customers, predict behaviour, and make smarter decisions.

This project integrates multiple AI components—data preprocessing, feature evaluation, churn prediction models, and an orchestrator that coordinates specialized agents to produce accurate, actionable insights.

The system exposes a unified FastAPI backend capable of:

* Predicting customer churn or conversion likelihood
* Computing key customer metrics such as CTR, lift, and engagement
* Running multi-agent workflows for deeper behavioural interpretation
* Providing real-time inference through a production-ready API endpoint

CustomerSense Engine is optimized for **Azure deployment** via Container Apps or Function Apps, enabling scalable cloud-native service delivery. The system runs on Uvicorn/Gunicorn inside a container and includes full environment configuration through `requirements.txt` and a customizable `startup.sh`.

The goal is to help organizations improve retention, enhance marketing strategies, personalize engagement, and ultimately increase customer lifetime value by using automated, intelligent, and data-driven decision-making.
